The Human-Data Interaction Lab is a virtual ITU lab comprised of about fifteen faculty members, Postdocs, PhD students, and Master students. 
Although mostly a virtual lab, we occupy the small physical presence between our offices situated in the 4D corridor in the ITU main building. 
<!-- In addition to our corridor space, the lab has access to a 3x3 meters (3.06m x 2.85m room) (4D29), which is dedicated for studies and 
study setups with focus on Human-Data Interaction. -->

The lab allows students and faculty to meet to discuss and collaborate on topics related to how people work with data, the technologies 
people use when working with data, and the tools that might be created to better support this. 

The lab, for example, facilitates technical prototyping, day-to-day interactions with students, conducting empirical lab studies, and 
demonstrating technology to collaborators and other visiting stakeholders.

Members of the lab see a need for a technical, hands-on approach to the are of Human-Data Interaction. This presents a concrete and 
tangible approach to working with data, for potential students and external stakeholders. Thus, we focus on understanding *how people
(including the society at large) work with data and how we might better support them in doing so*, rather than asking *how data is part of 
society and the challenges presented by that question*. However, many lab members see a connection between the concrete work with data, and 
the larger threads of how data permeates society at large.

Our lab space facilitaties work on interactive data prototypes and to discuss matters related to humans, data, and interaction. Occasionally,
it also facilitates small demo sessions, presentations, and study group meetings during outside hours targeted towards interested students.

Most of the students affiliated with the lab is doing research-based projects or thesis work. The lab serves as a hub for people to exchange 
ideas and to collaborate. Additionally, we occasionally organize talks and other extracurricular activities for students centered around the 
focus areas of the lab.

Organisation of extracurricular activities
*	Weekly data hacking activities hosted by our [student assistant](mailto:hdilab-datahacking@o365team.itu.dk). All students are welcome!
*	Guest lectures by visiting researchers
*	Company presentations. For example, we have continual dialogue with Inviso – a company specializing in data analysis services with a strong 
  focus on visualization – to create ways for them to interact with students for mutual benefit.
